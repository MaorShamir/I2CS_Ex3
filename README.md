pacman needs to "eat" all the pink pixels, by going in the shortest path to the closest pink.

if pacman touch monster(when monster is big), game over.
so I will set the condition: if pacman's distance from monster is smaller then 8 pixels(for example) valid path, pacman need to runaway to up than 8 pixels away.

if pacman eats green dot, monsters become eatable(smaller) for many seconds. if pacman's distance from small monster is less than 5, pacman chase monster.
if pacman eats monster when it's small, the monster disapear.
